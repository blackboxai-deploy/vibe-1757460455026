# Space Shooting Game - Implementation Progress

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Project Structure Setup
- [ ] Create Next.js root layout (layout.tsx)
- [ ] Create main game page (page.tsx)
- [ ] Set up Canvas container with proper sizing

### Phase 2: Core Game Engine
- [ ] Implement game loop with requestAnimationFrame
- [ ] Create entity management system with object pooling
- [ ] Build collision detection engine with AABB
- [ ] Add keyboard input handling system
- [ ] Implement game state management (Menu/Playing/Paused/GameOver)

### Phase 3: Game Entities
- [ ] Create Player ship class with movement and shooting
- [ ] Implement Enemy types (Basic, Fast, Tank, Boss)
- [ ] Build Projectile system (player/enemy bullets)
- [ ] Create Power-up system (RapidFire, Shield, MultiShot)
- [ ] Add Particle effects for explosions and trails

### Phase 4: Visual & Audio Systems
- [ ] Implement HUD with health, score, power-up indicators
- [ ] Add sound effects and background music
- [ ] Create visual polish (animations, screen shake)
- [ ] Style game interface with modern design

### Phase 5: Game States & Progression
- [ ] Create menu system with start screen
- [ ] Implement pause functionality
- [ ] Add game over screen with score display
- [ ] Build progressive wave system with difficulty scaling

### Phase 6: Image Processing & Build
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

### Phase 7: Testing & Optimization
- [ ] API testing with curl commands
- [ ] Performance optimization and memory management
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (desktop/mobile)
- [ ] Final bug fixes and balance tuning
